Story Time from ASU SER 316 Fall-2022-B Team Gugelhupf:
Come one come all and gather around for a short story about Dr. Mehlhase and her trip to Schloss Eltz.  
It after a dare from some freinds at the local ratskller.  
They knew she was a wettbewerbsfaehig person so they dared her to enter a Rammstein karaoke competition at Schloss Eltz.
First, Mehlhase knew that she could not sing well on an empty stomach. Starting her trip at the local Baeckerei, she ordered zwei Apfelkuchens und eine Gebaeck.
She told her mates to pull up their lederhosen because she was on a mission!
