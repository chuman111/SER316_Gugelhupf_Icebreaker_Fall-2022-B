Story Time from ASU SER 316 Fall-2022-B Team Gugelhupf:
Come one come all and gather around for a short story about Dr. Mehlhase and her trip to Schloss Eltz. It after a dare from some freinds at the local ratskller. They 
knew she was a wettbewerbsfaehig person so they dared her to enter a Rammstein karaoke competition at Schloss Eltz.
